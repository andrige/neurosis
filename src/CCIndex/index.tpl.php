<h1>Welcome to Neurosis</h1>
<p>Hi! This is Neurosis, a rebranding and complete rehash (almost) of the Lydia Framework by Michael Roos. See the header for more information about his work.</p>
<p>My name is Markus Lundberg and I hope you'll like using this.</p>
<p>For information about how to use this page, see the readme in the root folder of this project. You can login in as admin using user/password <code>root/root</code>. Then click the Gravatar icon to quickly change it something else, or create a new user and set admin rights to it using the administrator interface.</p>
<p>If you want to see debug options, see the <code>site/config.php</code> for lots of settings. Sorry that there's no web interface for it yet!</p>

=======
<h1>Index Controller</h1>
<p>This is what you can do for now.</p>

<?php foreach($menu as $val): ?>
<li><a href='<?=create_url($val)?>'><?=$val?></a> 
<?php endforeach; ?>
